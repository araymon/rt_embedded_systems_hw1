This code was tested on Ubuntu 16.04.
To run the code, you need to first install gtest.
Run the following command on the command line:


sudo apt-get install googletest


Then compile googletest's static libraries and place them in the right location.
This can be done with these commands:


cd /usr/src/gtest
sudo cmake CMakeLists.txt
sudo make
sudo cp *.a /usr/lib
sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/googletest
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libgtest.a /usr/local/lib/googletest/libgtest.a
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libgtest_main.a /usr/local/lib/googletest/libgtest_main.a


*it is important to note that /usr/src/gtest/ may be titled /usr/src/googletest 
so it is important to try both directories

Once you have googletest installed, it is time to install doxygen.
This can be done with the following command:


sudo apt-get install doxygen


* you may also need graphiz installed. I didn't but a friend did on Ubuntu 18.04
This can be installed with this command:


sudo apt-get install graphviz


Now that these two components are installed it's time to run my code.
Simply type this on the commandline in the provided directory:


make 
make docs


The executable can be run with this command:


./bin/hw1 


This executable also runs the test cases along with the main program.

Finally, the results of doxygen can be located by opening this file with a 
browser: ./doc/html/index.html
